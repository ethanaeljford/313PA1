1. Plot the program execution time / filesize: When transferring the data with different file sizes here is the raw data that i received:
- 5MB - 1.282 Seconds
- 10MB - 2.857 seconds
- 50MB - 10.009 seconds
- 100MB - 18.527 seconds
- 1000MB - 2.296e-05 seconds
With this data we can see that the time it takes to copy over is pretty linear up util we get to 100 MB, and then starts to speed up a little faster. And then we you get to the 1K MB, It gets significantly faster. 

2. Why there is this trend: Because the bigger the file, the more operating system optimizes its operation. We can especially see this when it reaches a GB, and It is even faster than 100 MB. This is because despite it being larger, the computer gives more resources to compute the answer.
